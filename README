  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
  |    valid     |      Y      |      Y      |      N      |
  +--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP
along with patch descriptions use git whatchanged on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
  # git whatchanged v5.2/base..v5.2/standard/nxp-lsdk-20.04/nxp-ls1046


4. Boot Instructions
====================

The typical u-boot settings apply to these boards. You will need to use
setenv, printenv and saveenv, to configure, display and store respectively
your network configuration details and kernel command line. In order to
TFTP a kernel, you need at a minimum to set the following:

	- ipaddr
	- gatewayip
	- netmask
	- serverip
	- loadaddr
	- dtbfile
	- dtbaddr
	- ethaddr
	- eth1addr

Target specifics are usually set in the "bootargs" variable, and the
kernel image is set in the "kernelfile" variable. Don't forget that if you
want these values to be available after a power cycle you will need to run
the saveenv command.

Typically convenience macros exist that will create a complete bootargs
command line for the kernel based on variables that contain individual
settings.  Since these macros exist as env variables themselves, they
may or may not be present depending on who installed and configured
u-boot for the board.

The console device for the board is ttyS0 at 115200 baud. For the DTB
address, 0x90000000 was used with success by Wind River. The load address
must be high enough to not interfere with kernel decompression. A value
of 0x81000000 was used with success for all kernels tested by Wind River.

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Example settings for the monitor (u-boot) are shown below:

nfsboot=setenv bootargs root=/dev/nfs rw nfsroot=$serverip:$rootpath \
ip=$ipaddr:$serverip:$gatewayip:$netmask:$hostname:$netdev:off \
console=$consoledev,$baudrate $othbootargs;tftp $kernel_addr_r $kernelfile; \
tftp $fdt_addr_r $fdtfile;booti $kernel_addr_r - $fdt_addr_r
ethaddr=00:04:9F:02:00:FD
eth1addr=00:04:9F:02:01:FD
eth2addr=00:04:9F:02:02:FD
kernel_addr_r=0x81000000
fdt_addr_r=0x90000000
gatewayip=192.168.1.1
netmask=255.255.255.0
ipaddr=192.168.1.100
serverip=192.168.1.2
netdev=eth0
kernelfile=Image
fdtfile=fsl-ls1046-rdb-sdk.dtb
rootpath=/tftpboot/rootfs
consoledev=ttyS0
baudrate=115200
othbootargs=earlycon=uart8250,mmio,0x21c0500

4.2 Booting from SPI flash
--------------------------
4.2.1 On-Board SPI Flash vbank Configuration
------------------------------------------
The LS1046ARDB provides two QSPI flash memories (part number: S25FS512SDSMFI011) 
for storing images (RCW/UBoot/kernel/PPA/FMan microcode):
 - Flash memory connected to chip select 0 (CS0): Represents the default virtual bank (bank 0)
 - Flash memory connected to chip select 1 (CS1): Represents the alternative virtual bank (bank 4)
Below description shows the memory addresses (memory map) for storing board configuration data on 
virtual bank 0 and virtual bank 4.
4.2.2 NXP's pre-built image
--------------------------

NXP provides a pre-built image which contains U-Boot, RCW, etc.
Please download it through:

 wget https://www.nxp.com/lgfiles/sdk/lsdk2004/firmware_ls1046ardb_uboot_qspiboot.img

and burn it to the target board under the U-Boot prompt using the commands below:

=> tftp a0000000 firmware_ls1046ardb_uboot_qspiboot.img
=> sf probe 0:1
=> sf erase 0 +$filesize && sf write a0000000 0 $filesize

Then use

=> cpld reset altbank

to switch to vbank4.

4.2.3 Set board switch
----------------------

Board can boot from SPI flash by setting sw5[1:8] as '00100010'.


4.3 NAND Flash Root File System
-------------------------------
4.3.1 Generate the boot image:
------------------------------
Configure your project with the following options to enable necessary kernel
options:
        --templates feature/yaffs2-utils

After build, program the image into flash with following command:
For ubifs filesystems:
	# flash_erase /dev/mtd0 0 0
	# ubiattach /dev/ubi_ctrl -m 0
	# ubimkvol /dev/ubi0 -N root -s 480MiB
	# mkdir /mnt/ubifs
	# mount -t ubifs ubi0:root /mnt/ubifs
	# tar xfj wrlinux-image-glibc-std-nxp-ls1046.tar.bz2 --numeric-owner -C /mnt/ubifs/
	# umount /mnt/ubifs/

The followings are for YAFFS2 filesystem:

	# flash_erase /dev/mtd0 0 0
	# mkdir /mnt/yaffs2
	# mount -t yaffs /dev/mtdblock0 /mnt/yaffs2
	# tar xfj wrlinux-image-glibc-std-nxp-ls1046.tar.bz2 --numeric-owner -C /mnt/yaffs2/
	# umount /mnt/yaffs2/

NOTE: Before writing to the flash memory you need to know its layout, you can
get this kind information by running 'cat /proc/mtd' on your target. please
ensure that an appropriate file system is created to fit the available space.

4.3.2 Deployment
----------------

After loading the kernel, pass kernel arguments as shown:

	ubi.mtd=0 root=ubi0:root rw rootfstype=ubifs console=ttyS0,115200

	or: root=/dev/mtdblock0 rw rootfstype=yaffs console=ttyS0,115200

4.4 Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
------------------------------------
User can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create the properly
partitioned image on a SD card. The wic command
generates partitioned images from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
User can refer to the below URL to get more WIC details:

http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/2.6/mega-manual/mega-manual.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

This BSP supports disk images for SD card.
After build the project, user will get a WIC image under the directory
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<bsp name>/ ,such as:

WIC image for SD card:
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-ls1046/wrlinux-image-std-nxp-ls1046.wic


Then user can write the output image to a SD card. WIC image contains kernel,
dtb, rootfs and u-boot. User still need to write fman microcode image to SD card
by "dd" command.

To change default booting configuration in uboot, user can overwrite following
variable in uboot and save to SD by saveenv command:

- kernelfile, define kernel image file name.
- fdtfile, define device-tree image file name.
- othbootargs, define additional booting parameters pass to kernel.

4.4.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

To burn uboot and WIC images to SD card, user need to execute two steps:

1) Burn WIC image

# dd if=wrlinux-image-std-nxp-ls1046.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

2) Burn NXP pre-built SD image

NXP provides a pre-built SD image which contains U-Boot, RCW, firmware, etc.
Please download it through:
"wget https://www.nxp.com/lgfiles/sdk/lsdk2004/firmware_ls1046ardb_uboot_sdboot.img"

# dd if=firmware_ls1046ardb_uboot_sdboot.img of=/dev/your_sd_dev bs=512 seek=8 conv=fsync


Note: NXP does not provide a pre-built eMMC image which contains U-Boot, RCW, firmware, etc.
So we can not support WIC for eMMC.

5.2. Multilib
-------------

By default, this BSP is configured as a 64-bit kernel and 64-bit userspace
with 32-bit userspace multilib support.

Multilib is also supported by this BSP.

1. To add 32-bit multilib support for an existing project, use:

    bitbake lib32-wrlinux-image-std

2. To add 32-bit mulilib support for a specific package, use:

    bitbake lib32-<pkg-name>

5.3 kexec/kdump
---------------

To build the boot or capture kernel, use the following option with the configure
command for your project:

     --templates feature/kexec feature/kdump

To reserve a memory region for the capture kernel, pass "crashkernel=512M"
via the U-Boot command line.

NOTES:
1. Use vmlinux as a secondary kernel. It can be found in the directory
   tmp-glibc/work/<bsp name>-wrs-linux/linux-yocto/<kernel version>/linux-<bsp name>-<kernel type>-build/vmlinux

2. 512 MB (the size of the memory reserved for crash kernel) is the
   recommended amount of memory. If you add more features to the kernel, you
   can increase this value to accommodate the capture kernel.

3. Kdump: PCI-MSI and SMP is unsupported in 2nd kernel.
   User needs to append two arguments "pci=nomsi maxcpus=1".
   Since this 2nd kernel operates under significantly constrained
   initialization conditions and is not meant to be a "replacement" kernel.
   Rather it has a single goal -- to enable data collection with respect to
   the issue that impacted the initial kernel, and nothing else.

4. Same with LSDK, DPAA1 should be compiled out while creating the image for
   dump-capture 2nd kernel. With "CONFIG_FSL_SDK_DPA=n" & "CONFIG_FSL_SDK_DPAA_ETH=n"
   in the kernel .config setting to disable DPAA1, can choose PCIe device "CONFIG_E1000E=y"
   as a replacement to make NFS working.
   Please refer to the chapter 7.3 "Known bugs, limitations or technical issues" of "LSDKUG_Rev20.04.pdf".

For more detailed information about kdump, please refer to
Documentation/kdump/kdump.txt in the kernel source tree.

5.4 DPDK
========

7.4.1 Install DPDK
------------------
By default, the DPDK user space package is not installed. In order to install the
package to your rootfs, you should add the below setting to
"${buildprj}/build/conf/local.conf":
	IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " dpdk"
5.4.2 Boot Arguments
--------------------
The following boot arguments can be used in order to obtain the best performance
for DPDK applications:
 default_hugepagesz=2MB hugepagesz=2MB hugepages=448 isolcpus=1-3 bportals=s0 qportals=s0

To use DPDK applications, user need load specific DTB, fsl-ls1046a-rdb-usdpaa.dtb.
The DTB can be found in tmp-glibc/deploy/images/nxp-ls1046/, and it alread
installed into WIC image.

5.4.3 Sample Applications
-----------------------
In order to get the sample applications provided by the DPDK, you need to enable
bsp-extras template. You can use the steps like the following to run the sample
applications. Take the l2fwd as example:
  1. Configure the DPAA platform:
	export DPAA_NUM_RX_QUEUES=1
	export DPAA_FMC_MODE=1
	fmc -c /usr/share/dpdk/dpaa/usdpaa_config_ls1046.xml \
		 -p /usr/share/dpdk/dpaa/usdpaa_policy_hash_ipv4_1queue.xml -a
	mkdir /mnt/hugepages
	mount -t hugetlbfs none /mnt/hugepages

  2. Run the layer 2 forwarding application:
       /usr/share/dpdk/examples/l2fwd -c 0x2 -n 1 -- -p 0x1 -q 1

5.5 LS1026A
-----------

Setting sw3[2] to '0' can disable core 3 and 4 on SOC to make it act as dual
core processor LS1026A.
